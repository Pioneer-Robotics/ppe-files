# Pioneer PPE Files
## Keeping the prints free from contamination
- Act as if you were infected by the COVID-19 virus. Wear a face mask and a fresh pair of gloves when collecting each batch of printed parts. Store the parts immediately in a sealable bag.
- Talk with whoever you’re making the shields for, let them know about your manufacturing environment
- There is still debate about how long the virus survives on plastic, but most sources mention 2-3 days. That means that by letting the packed face shields sit for 2-3 days before distributing them, you’ll greatly reduce risk of transmission
- Do not store the entire stock in one place, minimize the risk of cross contamination
